[KDL](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl) is a document language with xml-like
semantics that looks like you're invoking a bunch of CLI commands!

[Inline KDL](https://github.com/passcod/i-kdl) (short: i-kdl, extension: ikdl,
pronounced: i cuddle) is an extension of KDL where KDL fragments can be embedded
in a larger text document.

i-kdl uses `<` and `>` to indicate a KDL fragment. An i-kdl document is a list
of zero or more Texts interspersed with zero or more Nodes.

## Examples

Simple:

```ikdl
Hic voluptatem eum et repudiandae nisi cum qui sed. Voluptatum molestiae recusa
quod<note latin { quƒ´ case=nominative gender=neuter number=singular }> quas
suscipit reprehenderit eos commodi. Dolores earum iste tempore culpa ut nostrum.
```

Can span multiple lines:

```ikdl
Inflection of quƒ´ (‚Äúwho, which‚Äù), Proto-Indo-European *k ∑od, whence also <word hw√¶t
lang="Old English" {
  translation lang=English what
}>.
```

KDL fragment can contain `<>` in strings etc.

```ikdl
i-kdl uses <code "<"> and <code ">"> to indicate a KDL fragment.
```
